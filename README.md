### Part 2 - Management of Relational & Non-Relational Databases

* Databases need to be structured properly to enable efficient and effective querying and analysis of data. 
* Build normalized, consistent and performant relational data models. 
* Use SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) to create the data schemas designed in Postgres and apply SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) to migrate data from a denormalized schema to a normalized one. 
* Understand the tradeoffs between relational databases and their non-relational counterparts and justify which one is best for different scenarios. 
* With a radical shift of paradigms, learn about MongoDB and Redis to get an understanding of the differences in behaviors and requirements for non-relational databases.
